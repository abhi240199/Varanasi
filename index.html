            <h1> History</h1>
            <p>
                Varanasi is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Its early history is that of
                the first Aryan settlement in the middle Ganges valley. By the 2nd millennium BCE, Varanasi was a seat
                of Aryan religion and philosophy and was also a commercial and industrial centre famous for its muslin
                and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Varanasi was the capital of the kingdom of Kashi
                during the time of the Buddha (6th century BCE), who gave his first sermon nearby at Sarnath. The city
                remained a centre of religious, educational, and artistic activities as attested by the celebrated
                Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited it in about 635 CE and said that the city extended for
                about 3 miles (5 km) along the western bank of the Ganges.
